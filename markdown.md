# Markdown Files

Whether you write your book's content in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or
in regular markdown files (`.md`), you'll write in the same flavor of markdown
called **MyST Markdown**.
This is a simple file to help you get started and show off some syntax.

## What is MyST?

MyST stands for "Markedly Structured Text". It
is a slight variation on a flavor of markdown called "CommonMark" markdown,
with small syntax extensions to allow you to write **roles** and **directives**
in the Sphinx ecosystem.

For more about MyST, see [the MyST Markdown Overview](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html).

## Sample Roles and Directives

Roles and directives are two of the most powerful tools in Jupyter Book. They
are like functions, but written in a markup language. They both
serve a similar purpose, but **roles are written in one line**, whereas
**directives span many lines**. They both accept different kinds of inputs,
and what they do with those inputs depends on the specific role or directive
that is being called.
[here's my label](sample_roles).
Here is a "note" directive:

```{note}
Here is a note
```

It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.

Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.


## Citations

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the $this_{is}^{inline}$ references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:


```{math}
:label: my_label
w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1}
```

$$
  w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1}
$$ (my_other_label)

If $\hat P$ is the fixed point of the map $\mathcal B \circ \mathcal D$ and $\hat F$ is the robust policy as given in [(7)](https://python-advanced.quantecon.org/robustness.html#equation-rb-oc-ih), then

```{math}
:label: rb_kft

K(\hat F, \theta) = (\theta I - C'\hat P C)^{-1} C' \hat P  (A - B \hat F)
```

Next, we shut down randomness in demand and assume that the demand shock
$\nu_t$ follows a deterministic path:


```{math}
\nu_t = \alpha + \rho \nu_{t-1}
```

Again, weâ€™ll compute and display outcomes in some figures

```python
ex2 = SmoothingExample(C2=[[0], [0]])

x0 = [0, 1, 0]
ex2.simulate(x0)
```

If $A$ is a convergent matrix, then there exists a matrix norm such
that $\vert \vert A \vert \vert < 1$.
```


````{prf:proof} Orthogonal-Projection-Theorem
:label: my-theorem

Given $y \in \mathbb R^n$ and linear subspace $S \subset \mathbb R^n$,
there exists a unique solution to the minimization problem

```{math}
\hat y := \argmin_{z \in S} \|y - z\|
```

The minimizer $\hat y$ is the unique vector in $\mathbb R^n$ that satisfies

* $\hat y \in S$

* $y - \hat y \perp S$


The vector $\hat y$ is called the **orthogonal projection** of $y$ onto $S$.
